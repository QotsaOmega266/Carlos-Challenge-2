        <p>
            I was born in Reno, Nevada and lived in the small town of Winnemucca until my family moved 
            out to Kingman, AZ in 2008. I'm Filipino-American and I love spending most of my summer 
            vacations in the Philippines with my family and relatives.
            I graduated with my Associate's Degree of Computer Information Systems Admin in 2016 and eventually
            landed a job as a Petroleum Service Technician working on fuel dispensers, hydraulics, 
            and POS network systems. Learning full-stack software development, I have two goals 
            that I aim to accomplish. Of all the subjects in the IT field, coding is my weakest and 
            I plan to turn that weakness into a strength now that I'm more familiar with code than I was several
            years ago. The other goal is to enhance my coding skills with my IT experience and explore bigger and 
            broader opportunites for both a hobby and a life-time career.
